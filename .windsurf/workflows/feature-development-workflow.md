# Feature Development Workflow

## Overview
This document establishes the workflow for developing features in the Espresso ML application, following the established work item organization rules.

## Workflow Process

### 1. Feature Development Lifecycle

#### Phase 1: Planning
- **Review Requirements**: Analyze requirements document (R-XXX)
- **Review User Stories**: Understand user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Task Breakdown**: Ensure all acceptance criteria have corresponding tasks
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify task dependencies and critical path
- **Resource Planning**: Estimate effort and allocate resources

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- **Task Execution**: Work through tasks in dependency order
- **Code Development**: Write code following established patterns
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Update component documentation

#### Phase 3: Integration
- **Feature Integration**: Combine components into complete feature
- **Cross-feature Testing**: Test interactions between features
- **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete user workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure performance requirements are met

#### Phase 4: Review & Refinement
- **Code Review**: Peer review of implementation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Verify acceptance criteria are met
- **Bug Fixing**: Address any identified issues
- **Documentation Updates**: Update all related documentation

### 2. Task Execution Guidelines

#### Task Selection
- **Critical Path First**: Always work on critical path tasks
- **Parallel Work**: Work on independent tasks in parallel
- **Blockers**: Identify and resolve blocking issues quickly
- **Progress Tracking**: Update task status daily

#### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Follow established coding standards
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation current with code
- **Performance**: Meet performance requirements

#### Validation Requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each task must validate at least one acceptance criterion
- **Traceability**: Every task must trace back to requirements
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Sign-off**: Tasks require review and approval

### 3. File Organization Standards

#### Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── requirements.md      # Business requirements (R-XXX)
├── features/            # Features and user stories
│   └── shot-crud-operations.md
│   └── authentication-authorization.md
│   └── automatic-model-training.md
│   └── machine-maintenance-alerts.md
│   └── shot-predictions.md
├── tasks/              # Implementation tasks
│   └── shot-crud-operations.md
│   └── authentication-authorization.md
│   └── automatic-model-training.md
│   └── machine-maintenance-alerts.md
│   └── shot-predictions.md
```

#### File Naming Conventions
- **Requirements**: `requirements.md` (R-XXX numbering)
- **Features**: `features/[feature-name].md` (X.Y numbering)
- **Tasks**: `tasks/[feature-name].md` (X.Y.Z numbering)

#### Content Standards
- **Templates**: Use established templates for each document type
- **Numbering**: Follow X.Y.Z schema consistently
- **Traceability**: Maintain clear traceability links
- **Version History**: Track all changes with dates

### 4. Development Environment Setup

#### Tool Requirements
- **IDE**: VS Code with recommended extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Documentation**: Markdown with live preview

#### Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: `main` for production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/[feature-name]` for development
- **Release Branches**: `release/[version]` for releases
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/[issue-description]` for urgent fixes

#### Commit Standards
- **Message Format**: `type(scope): description`
- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`
- **Scope**: Feature or component name
- **References**: Include task numbers and acceptance criteria

### 5. Quality Assurance Process

#### Code Review Checklist
- **Functionality**: Does it meet acceptance criteria?
- **Code Quality**: Does it follow coding standards?
- **Testing**: Are tests comprehensive and passing?
- **Documentation**: Is documentation updated?
- **Performance**: Does it meet performance requirements?

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Validate performance requirements
- **Accessibility Tests**: Verify WCAG compliance

#### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- **Criteria Coverage**: All acceptance criteria must be tested
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, test results, performance metrics
- **Sign-off**: Stakeholder approval required
- **Traceability**: Update traceability matrix

### 6. Release Management

#### Release Readiness
- **Feature Complete**: All tasks marked as completed
- **Testing Complete**: All tests passing
- **Documentation Complete**: All docs updated
- **Performance Met**: Performance requirements satisfied

#### Release Process
- **Version Planning**: Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- **Release Notes**: Document changes and improvements
- **Deployment**: Staged deployment with rollback capability
- **Monitoring**: Post-release monitoring and issue tracking

#### Post-Release
- **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback
- **Issue Tracking**: Monitor and address reported issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics
- **Continuous Improvement**: Identify and implement improvements

### 7. Collaboration Guidelines

#### Team Communication
- **Daily Standups**: Progress updates and blocker identification
- **Weekly Reviews**: Feature progress and planning adjustments
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep all team members informed
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular knowledge sharing sessions

#### Handoff Procedures
- **Clear Documentation**: Complete handoff documentation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensure knowledge is transferred
- **Support Period**: Post-handoff support availability
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect and address handoff feedback
